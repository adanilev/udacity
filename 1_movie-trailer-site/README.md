# Movie Trailer Website

This is my first assignment for the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. It is intended to demonstrate basic knowledge of OOP and Python.

## Quick Start
* Make sure you have Python installed
* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/adanilev/udacity`
* Navigate to this `udacity/1_movie-trailer-site/` in your terminal of choice
* Run `python entertainment_center.py `

## Notes
* `fresh_tomatoes.py` was written by the udacity team. I slightly modified the css.
* I've been watching a lot of "Star Trek: Next Generation" lately :)
